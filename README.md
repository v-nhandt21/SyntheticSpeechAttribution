# Synthetic Speech Attribution

2022 IEEE Signal Processing Cup

This competition is sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society and MathWorks

The IEEE Signal Processing Societyâ€™s 2022 Signal Processing Cup (SP Cup) will be a synthetic
speech attribution challenge. Teams will be requested to design and develop a system for
synthetic speech attribution. This means, given an audio recording representing a
synthetically generated speech track, to detect which method among a list of candidate
ones has been used to synthesize the speech. The detector must rely on the analysis of the
speech signal through signal processing and machine learning techniques.

# Usage

## Dataset Prepare

Download data:

- Seen Data:

``` https://www.dropbox.com/s/36yqmymkva2bwdi/spcup_2022_training_part1.zip?dl=1 ```

- Unseen Data:

``` https://www.dropbox.com/s/wsmlthhri29fb79/spcup_2022_unseen.zip?dl=1 ```

- Prepare two script file for training: train.txt, val.txt with format:

``` <path to wav file>,<label>```

Example:

```wav/329cc66d02e4962ac4ead01e2bdef2c3.wav,4```

[Option] Check Config hparameter for training and melspectrogram feature, especially segment_size which is length of audio sample:

``` config.json ```

## Training

Install requirement: pytorch, librosa, onnxruntime-gpu, matlab

Training model using efficientNet b0

``` python train.py ```

## Prediction

``` 
python predict.py --file_out <part_scores.csv> \
--evaluation_folder <path_to_spcup_2022_eval_part1>\
--checkpoint_path_unseen <checkpoint unseen>  \
--checkpoint_path <checkpoint algorithm> \
--config config.json 
```

## Export Onnx
Export to onnx with static input (prefer)

``` python onnx_export.py [Option: model_path] ```

[Option] Export to onnx with dynamic input (need to handle in matlab)

## Inference Onnx with Matlab

Extract melspectrogram for inference in matlab (suppose test set from testing file: Static/data/test.txt)

``` python meldataset.py ```

Inspect matlab script to evaluation then submit final result, Check the script at:

``` matlab_inference.mlx ```
